## Personal Tech Takes

**httpx**: A modern alternative to Requests with the same intuitive API, plus async support and HTTP/2 for better performance.

**Polars**: A high-performance DataFrame library—10 to 30 times faster than Pandas, using much less memory. Definitely worth exploring.

**selectolax**: A lightning-fast HTML parser, up to 25x faster than Beautiful Soup, built on a modern parsing engine.

**FastAPI**: The go-to web framework with native async support, automatic interactive docs, and built-in type hints.

**Plotly & Altair**: Upgrade your data visualization — Plotly for rich interactivity, Altair for clean, declarative charts.

**Streamlit:** The fastest way to turn Python scripts into shareable web apps
